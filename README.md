The main goal of the Snake game project I recently finished in C was to use the C programming language to create a traditional arcade-style game. In the game, a snake moves around the screen and eats food to lengthen its body. The project has an easy-to-use command-line interface, and arrow keys are used by players to control the snake's movement. Essential features in the game include the snake moving automatically, growing while it eats, and game over situations that are brought on by collisions with the snake's body or the screen borders. The snake's length determines how points are awarded. Technically speaking, this project has improved my knowledge of how to implement game logic in C, handle user input, work with arrays and data structures, and manage
